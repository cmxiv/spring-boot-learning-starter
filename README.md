1. Spring?
    * What?
    ```
    Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications.
    
    Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application.
    ```
    * Dependency Injection & Inversion of Control (IoC)
    ```
   Java applications typically consists of objects that collaborate to form the application proper. Thus, the objects in an application
   have dependencies on each other.
   
   The Spring Framework Inversion of Control (IoC) component addresses this concern by providing a formalized means of composing
   disparate components into a fully working application ready for use. The Spring Framework codifies formalized design patterns as
   first-class objects that you can integrate into your own application(s). 
    ```
1. Spring Boot?
    * Why?
    * start.spring.io
    * What's the difference??
1. Gradle? Maven? Build tooling?
1. Adding library dependencies
    * In existing code base (focusing on Gradle)
    * While creating a project with start.spring.io
1. Hello World! (from the Spring Boot)
1. Simple REST API with database interaction
    * Testing (Duh!)
1. Publish as Jar
